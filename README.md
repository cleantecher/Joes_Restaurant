This project is intended to create a website for a restraurant

Used a style element to add the images to make the scoll easier

Copied and pasted the menu from the Joe-menu.md file. This could be automated by creating a list of dictionaries if the menu changes often but, just as simple to change it in the code for now.

added some styling elements, manipulated the image to have a smoother experience reading the menu with the image as a background
