CHALLENGE 1 HTML AND CSS- JOES RESTAURANT

The picture url was placed in the style tags because I thought it looked
nicer to have a brighter pic for the landing and then a duller one for
the menu. I used a styling to achieve the scrolling

I did not understand if you wanted the menu to look like an actual box
I looked at a bunch of websites and thought the format looked nicer as a single
scroll. A bit like a fancy menu you get in a restaurant. I would have used bootstrap 
to do the col and row if you wanted that but as not clear. 

I assumed you wanted to copy and paste the menu items as I did and not read them 
direct from the joes-menu.md file

relevant files to challenge:
index.html- the full code is in here
hero-image_grey.jpg- this is the pic i manipulated for the menu
joes-menu.md- the file with the menu items needed for the code
styles-readonly.css- the base formatting you had provided for the webpage

CHALLENGE 2 PSEUDOCODE
The code was fairly simple to write so I just wrote it out 
with the explanation inline with the code

relevant files to challenge:
pseudocode.py- this has both the code you provided, the solution and the problem

CHALLLENGE 3 JAVASCRIPT
I did not know if you wanted the random numbers to be integers 
(you may have told me but im a lil dyslecsic so coudnt find the instruction)
I assumed integers

javascript_fundamentals.js- all the code is provided between the intructions
